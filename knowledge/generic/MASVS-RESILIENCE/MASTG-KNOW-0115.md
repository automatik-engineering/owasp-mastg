title: Dynamic Binary Instrumentation
---

Another useful approach for native binaries is dynamic binary instrumentations (DBI). Instrumentation frameworks such as Valgrind and PIN support fine-grained instruction-level tracing of single processes. This is accomplished by inserting dynamically generated code at runtime. Valgrind compiles fine on Android, and pre-built binaries are available for download.

The [Valgrind README](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/dist.readme-android.html "Valgrind README") includes specific compilation instructions for Android.
