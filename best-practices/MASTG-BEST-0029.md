note: Resilience controls and RASP (Runtime Application Self-Protection) style checks are defense in depth measures that raise attacker cost by detecting risky environments and runtime tampering. They do not replace secure design and they are inherently bypassable, so they should be selected and tuned based on the app's threat model and risk tolerance.
