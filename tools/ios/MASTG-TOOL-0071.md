The Xcode Command Line Tools are bundled with @MASTG-TOOL-0070. After installing @MASTG-TOOL-0070, run `xcode-select --install` to install the Xcode Command Line Tools package. This will be handy during testing of iOS apps as some of the tools (e.g. objection) are also relying on the availability of this package. Alternatively, you can [download the tools from the official Apple website](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/ "Apple iOS SDK").
