[Sileo](https://getsileo.app) is a third-party app store available for both rooted and rootless jailbreaks on iOS 12+. It provides a graphical user interface for `apt/dpkg` and lets you install apps, binaries, and tweaks. Sileo is packaged with popular jailbreaks such as Dopamine and palera1n.

!!! Warning "Installing apps"

    Installing applications via Sileo or any other third-party app store carries risks, as Apple does not validate them. Be careful when installing unknown applications.

Many jailbreak tools can be installed using Sileo. By default, Sileo has some package repositories configured. You can add new repositories by navigating to **Sources** -> **Edit**, then clicking **Add** in the top left.

Some helpful tools that can be installed this way:
