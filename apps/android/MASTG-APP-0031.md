VulnForum is an intentionally vulnerable mobile forum application designed for security testing and training, serving as a practical target for the test cases outlined in the MASTG.

The application uses a modern technology stack, featuring a native Android frontend built with **Kotlin and Jetpack Compose** and an API backend implemented with **Python Flask**.

It covers a broad spectrum of common mobile and API security flaws, including:

- **Injection:** SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Access Control:** Broken authorization logic and improper token validation.
- **Data Security:** Insecure data storage, verbose logging, and hardcoded secrets.
- **Platform:** Exploitable exported components and misconfigured deep links.

The repository provides detailed setup instructions and a specific set of **Flags/Challenges** for users to validate their exploitation skills.
