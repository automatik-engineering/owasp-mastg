## Before You Start

Before contributing content:

1. **Read the relevant guidelines** for the type of content you're writing
2. **Review existing examples** linked in each guideline document
3. **Understand the structure** and required metadata for your content type
4. **Test your content** (especially for demos and scripts) to ensure it works correctly
5. **Follow the [Style Guide](https://mas.owasp.org/contributing/5_Style_Guide/)** for general writing and formatting conventions

## Getting Help

If you have questions about writing content or need clarification on these guidelines:

- Review the [Contributing Guidelines](https://mas.owasp.org/contributing/)
- Ask in the [MASTG Discussions](https://github.com/OWASP/mastg/discussions)
- Contact the [project maintainers](https://mas.owasp.org/contact/)

## Content Quality Standards

All contributed content must meet the MASTG quality standards:

- **Accuracy**: Content must be technically correct and thoroughly tested
- **Completeness**: All required sections and metadata must be included
- **Clarity**: Writing should be clear, concise, and easy to understand
- **Reproducibility**: Examples, demos, and scripts must be reproducible
- **Relevance**: Content must be relevant to mobile application security testing
- **Maintenance**: Content should be maintainable and up-to-date with current mobile platforms

These guidelines ensure that the MASTG remains a high-quality, authoritative resource for mobile application security testing.
