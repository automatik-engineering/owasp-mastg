Many apps log informative (and potentially sensitive) messages to the console log. The log also contains crash reports and other useful information. You can collect console logs through multiple methods:

## Using @MASTG-TOOL-0070

1. Launch Xcode.
2. Connect your device to your host computer.
3. Choose **Window** -> **Devices and Simulators**.
4. Click on your connected iOS device in the left section of the Devices window.
5. Reproduce the problem.
6. Click on the **Open Console** button located in the upper right-hand area of the Devices window to view the console logs on a separate window.

To save the console output to a text file, go to the top right side of the Console window and click on the **Save** button.

## Using @MASTG-TOOL-0126

1. Connect your device to your host computer
2. Run`idevicesyslog` in your terminal. The output contains a lot of device specific logs, so you might want to filter out the output with `| grep YOUR_APP_NAME`

> **Note**: The `idevicesyslog` might not log all types of logs. E.g [debug](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslogtype/debug) and [info](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/os/oslogtype/info) logs might now be logged.
